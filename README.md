# This repository will serve as a virtual lab book for the BS32012 Bioinformatics Practical Project. 

## Aims of the practical. 
1) To develop practical skills required to effectively implement bioinformatics workflows
and data analysis, including building and importing data into a relational database, and
using the python programming language to query the database and elucidate relevant 
biological information. 
2) To develop understanding of how to work collaboratively on data analysis, through the
online repository GitHub. 
3)To understand provenance and sustainability in bioinformatics analysis.
